# ILAMB - International Land Model Benchmarking

The python package designed to help confront earth system models with reference
data products, and then present the results in a hierarchical set of webpages.
Please see [ilamb.org](https://www.ilamb.org) where we have details about the
datasets we use, the results we catalog, and the methods we employ.

## Funding
